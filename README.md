I'm currently trying to complete <b>The Odin Project</b> <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript">JavaScript curriculum</a>.

<ul>
  <b><i>My fafourite projects from this curriculum are:</i></b>
  <li><a href="https://rgb-katana.github.io/odin-scetch/">Pixel Scetch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://rgb-katana.github.io/odin-calculator/">Calculator</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://rgb-katana.github.io/odin-restaurant/">Restaurant Page</a> (It's made using SASS and Webpack, but I kind of cheated and compiled SASS to CSS into /dist folder by myself. Also put /fonts and /images into /dist folder by hand, not through Webpack. Need to learn how it works, I guess. So in this project webpack is used only to bundje .js files.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rgb-katana.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/">Tic Tac Toe</a> (It has some problems)</li>
  <li><a href="https://rgb-katana.github.io/bubbles/">Aim for the bubbles</a> (It's actually not in The Odin Project curriculum. I did it by myself.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://rgb-katana.github.io/odin-dashboard/">Dashboard for imaginary admin panel</a> (It's made using SASS and npm scripts. No javascript, it's just HTML and SASS)</li>
</ul>

I'm thinking there will be more projects soon. And they'll be much more complex too. You can check the code for this projects in the repositories down below.
